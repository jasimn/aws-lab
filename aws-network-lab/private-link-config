how to configure private to access third party service securly.
create two vpc(vpc-consumer and vpc-provider)
create two subnets for each vpc(private-subnet and public-subnet| )
create route table( consumer-route-table-private and public | provider route-table-private and public )
create two instances for each vpc(one is in public subnet and another is in private subnet)
create internat gateway for each public subnet  to access internet
create nat gateway for each private nat to access internat through public subnet\
create nat gateway for provider private instances  only for donwload and configure apache webserver(after configuration delete nat gateway for provider private instance)
create target group(logical group of instancess)
create loadbalancer for preconfigured target group<network loadbalancer type>
create vpc endpoint service on provider vpc (private connectivity) for provider vpc service
create vpc endpoint on consumer vpc (private connectivity) for the gateway fo private ec2 instance
we need to attach endpoint service name to vpc endpoint
in vpc endpoint service go to <endpoint connection> | select vpc endpoint and go to <action> then accept endpoint connection request
